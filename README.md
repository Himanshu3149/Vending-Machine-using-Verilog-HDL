# Vending-Machine-using-Verilog-HDL
This Verilog project implements a vending machine that dispenses a cold drink for 15 cents. The machine accepts nickels (5 cents) and dimes (10 cents) as payment.

Features:

- Accepts nickels and dimes as payment
- Dispenses a cold drink for 15 cents
- Returns change if payment exceeds 15 cents

Note:

- This project is a simplified example and may not include all features of a real vending machine.
- The machine does not actually dispense a physical cold drink, but rather simulates the dispensing process.
